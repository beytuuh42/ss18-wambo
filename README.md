## Description:

The idea of our app comes from the app "Jodel" and reddit's commenting features.
We made a jodellike app and implemented a nested commenting system.
The App is based on node.js, Ionic (Angular) and MongoDB.

## Install instructions:
1. Clone the project

2. RUN in your local commandline:
docker-compose build
docker-compose up

3. if error occures, go into /app and /server and run local:
npm install

Repeat step 2.
